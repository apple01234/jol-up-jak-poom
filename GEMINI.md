üé® Core Design Philosophy
1. Visual Impact & Immersion
Elicit a ‚ÄúWow, this is insane‚Äù reaction.

Inspired by The Game Awards: high-contrast dark theme, cinematic cyberpunk aesthetics.

High-quality images, videos, and 3D assets are central to user immersion.

2. Modern & Clean Layout
Grid-based structure + minimalism.

Focus on content and interaction; avoid unnecessary decoration.

Glassmorphism, Neumorphism, Gradient Magic integrated creatively.

3. Color System
